	# These libraries don't work either because they require arduino/atmel processors, 
	#   define timings based on them, or use interfaces not implemented by the ESPs
	#   such as joystick (ESPs are incapable of implementing it with hardware)
	#   if you know how to fix the incompatibilities, you may do so by adding code in 
	#   lib/EspSimHub/EspSimHub.h
